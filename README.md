# UFOs

## Overview of UFOs
  ### Purpose
    The purpose of this assignment is to create a website and interact with it through javascript code. 
    The website helps build an understanding of what can be done to a project if given data, and how you
    can manipulate a table on html in order to filter results based on what you want to see. In addition,
    this assignment helps in understanding front end development as code is being used to manipulate the 
    results for the user.

  ### Results
    Using the website is pretty simple. On the left, there is a searchbar where the user can type in keywords.
    The more you type, the more specific sighting you will get. For example, lets say someone wants to find UFO
    sightings on 1/1/2010, and also in the city of benton, at the United States, and want a circle shaped UFO. They can
    type all that into the data and then they can get the specific results like this:

  ### Drawbacks
     One Drawback to this program is that it is case sensitives, so capitalization matters when trying to filter out searches.
     In addition, for countries, you have to enter the code for the country, not its full name in some instances. The date is also
     in one format only, so you cannot enter the date in different ways. To remedy this issue, you can have code that will make sure
     to accept any type of format for entering the date, the country, the city, and in upper or lower case. Another possible improvement,
     is if the website can extract data directly from another website, so that there can be constant updates on logging UFO sightings(Web Scraping)
     instead of just relying on a data object.
