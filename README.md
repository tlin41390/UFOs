# UFOs

## Overview of UFOs
  ### Purpose
    The purpose of this assignment is to create a website and interact with it through javascript code. 
    The website helps build an understanding of what can be done to a project if given data, and how you
    can manipulate a table on html in order to filter results based on what you want to see. In addition,
    this assignment helps in understanding front end development as code is being used to manipulate the 
    results for the user.

  ### Results
    Using the website is pretty simple. On the left, there is a searchbar where the user can type in keywords.
    The more you type, the more specific sighting you will get. For example, lets say someone wants to find UFO
    sightings on 1/1/2010, and also in the city of benton, at the United States, and want a circle shaped UFO. They can
    type all that into the data and then they can get the specific results like this:
